## HOW TO TEST YOUR PRESENT VOCABULARY
Once - as a child - you were an expert, an accomplished  virtuoso, at learning new words.
    Today, by comparison, you are a rank and bumbling amateur.
    Dose this statement sound insulting?
    It may be - but if you are the average adult, it is a statement that is, unfortunately, only too true.
    Educational testing indicates that children of ten who have grown up in families in which English is the native language have recognition vocabularies of over twenty thousand words -
    And that these same ten-year-olds have been learning new words at a rate of many hundreds a year since the age of four.
    In astonishing contrast, studies show that adults who are no longer attending school increase their vocabularies at a pace slower than twenty-five to fifty words annually.
    How do you assess your own vocabulary?
    Is it quantitatively healthy?
    Rich in overall range?
    Responsive to any situation in which you may find yourself?
    Truly indicative of your intellectual potential?
    More important, is it still growing at the same rapid rate as when you were a child?
    Or, as with most adults, has your rate of increase dropped drastically since you left school? And if so, do you now feel that your vocabulary is somewhat limited, your verbal skills not as sharp as you would like them to be?
    Let us find out.
    I challenge you to a series of tests that will measure your vocabulary range, as well as your verbal speed and responsiveness.

**A test of vocabulary range**
Here are sixty brief phrases, each containing one italicized word; it is up to you to find the closest definition of each such word. To keep your score valid, refrain, as far as possible, from wild guessing. The key will be found at the end of the test.

*This is a timed test.*
  *In no more than three minutes* (time yourself, or have someone time you), decide whether the word in column B is the *same* (or *approximately the same*) in meaning as the word in column A; *opposite* (or *approximately opposite*) in meaning; or whether the two words are merely *different*.
  Circle **S** for *same*, **O** for *opposite*, and **D** for *different*.
  You will not have time to dawdle or think too long, so go as fast as you can.

**VOCABULARY AND SUCCESS**

  Now you know where you stand. If you are in the below average or average group, you must consider, seriously, whether an inadequate vocabulary may be holding you back. (If you tested out on the above average, excellent, or superior level, you have doubtless already discovered the unique and far-reaching value of a rich vocabulary, and you are eager to add still further to your knowledge of words.) 
  Let us examine, briefly, some of the evidence that points to the close relationship between vocabulary and personal, professional, and intellectual growth.
  The Human Engineering Laboratory found that the only common characteristic of successful people in this country is an unusual grasp of the meanings of words. The Laboratory tested the vocabularies of thousands of people in all age groups and in all walks of life—and discovered that those people drawing down the highest salaries made the highest scores. Consider very thoughtfully the explanation that the director of the Laboratory offered for the relationship between vocabulary and success:
  "Why do large vocabularies characterize executives and possibly outstanding men and women in other fields? The final answer seems to be that words are the instruments by means of which men and women grasp the thoughts of others and with which they do much of their own thinking. They are the tools of thought."
  There is other evidence.
  At many universities, groups of freshmen were put into experimental classes for the sole purpose of increasing their knowledge of English words. *These groups did better in their sophomore, junior, and senior years than control groups of similarly endowed students who did not receive such training.*

[//]: # "p 18"

  And still more evidence: 
  At the University of Illinois, entering students were given a simple twenty-nine-word vocabulary test. The results of this test could be used, according to Professor William D. Templeman, to make an accurate prediction of future academic success—or lack of success—over the entire four year college course. "If a student has a superior vocabulary," states Professor Templeman, "it will 
probably follow that he will do better work academically."
  And finally: 
  Educational research has discovered that your I.Q. is intimately related to your vocabulary. Take a standard vocabulary test and then an intelligence test—the results in both will be substantially the same. 
  
**YOU CAN INCREASE YOUR VOCABULARY**

  The more extensive your vocabulary, the better your chances for success, other things being equal—success in attaining your educational goals, success in moving ahead in your business or professional career, success in achieving your intellectual potential.
  And you can increase your vocabulary—faster and easier than you may realize. 
  You can, in fact, accomplish a tremendous gain in less than two to three months of concentrated effort, even if you do only One session a day—in less time if you do two or more sessions a day.
  Furthermore— 
  You can start improving your vocabulary immediately—and within a few days you can be cruising along at such a rapid rate that there will be an actual change in your thinking, in your ability to express your thoughts, and in your powers of understanding.
  Does this sound as if I am promising you the whole world in a neat package with a pretty pink ribbon tied around it? I am. And I am willing to make such an unqualified promise because I have seen what happens to those of my students at New York University and at Rio Hondo College in Whittier, California, who make sincere, methodical efforts to learn more, many more, words.

[//]: # "p 19"

## HOW TO START BUILDING YOUR VOCABULARY
When you have finished working with this book, you will no longer be the same person.
  You can't be.
  If you honestly read every page, if you do every exercise, if you take every test, if you follow every principle, you will go through an intellectual experience that will effect a radical change in you.
  For if you systematically increase your vocabulary, you will also sharpen and enrich your thinking; push back your intellectual horizons; build your self-assurance; improve your facility in handling the English language and thereby your ability to express your thoughts effectively; and acquire a deeper understanding of the world in general and of yourself in particular.
  Increasing your vocabulary does not mean merely learning the definitions of large numbers of obscure words; it does not mean memorizing scores of unrelated terms. What it means—what it can only mean—is becoming acquainted with the multitudinous and fascinating phenomena of human existence for which words are, obviously, only the verbal descriptions.
  Increasing your vocabulary—properly, intelligently, and systematically—means treating yourself to an all-round, liberal education.

[//]: # "p 20"

  And surely you cannot deny that such an experience will change you intellectually—
  Will have a discernible effect on your methods of thinking—on your store of information—on your ability to express your ideas—on your understanding of human problems.

**HOW CHILDREN INCREASE THEIR VOCABULARIES**

  The typical ten-year-old, you will recall, has a recognition vocabulary of over twenty thousand words—and has been learning many hundreds of new words every year since the age of four. 
  *You were once that typical child.*
  *You were once an accomplished virtuoso at vocabulary building.*
  What was your secret?
  Did you spend hours every day poring over a dictionary?
  Did you lull yourself to sleep at night with Webster's Unabridged?
  Did you keep notebooks full of all the new words you ever heard or read?
  Did you immediately look up the meaning of any new word that your parents or older members of your family used?
  Such procedures would have struck you as absurd then, as absurd as they would be for you today.
  You had a much better, much more effective, and considerably less self-conscious method. 
  Your method was the essence of simplicity: day in and day out you kept learning; you kept squeezing every possible ounce of learning out of every waking moment; you were an eternal question box, for you had a constant and insatiable desire to know and understand.

[//]: # "p 21"

**HOW ADULTS STOP BUILDING THEIR VOCABULARIES**

  Then, eventually, at some point in your adult life (unless you are the rare exception), you gradually lost your compulsive drive to discover, to figure out, to understand, to know.
  Eventually, therefore, you gradually lost your need to increase your vocabulary—your need to learn the words that could verbalize your new discoveries, your new understanding, your new knowledge.
  Roland Gelatt, in a review of Caroline Pratt's book *I Learn from Children*, describes this phenomenon as follows:

>   All normal human beings are born with a powerful urge to
>   learn. Almost all of them lose this urge, even before they
>   have reached maturity. It is only the few...who are so
>   constituted that lack of learning becomes a nuisance. This is
>   perhaps the most insidious of human tragedies.

  Children are wonders at increasing their vocabularies because of their "powerful urge to learn." They do not learn solely by means of words, but as their knowledge increases, so does their 
vocabulary—for words are the symbols of ideas and understanding.
  (If you are a parent, you perhaps remember that crucial and trying period in which your child constantly asked "Why?" The "Why?" is the child's method of finding out. How many adults 
that you know go about asking and thinking "Why?" How often do you yourself do it?)
  The adults who "lose this urge," who no longer feel that "lack of learning becomes a nuisance," stop building their vocabularies. They stop learning, they stop growing intellectually, they stop 
changing. When and if such a time comes, then, as Mr. Gelatt so truly says, "This is perhaps the most insidious of human tragedies." But fortunately the process is far from irreversible.

[//]: # "p 22"

  If you have lost the "powerful urge to learn," you can regain it—you can regain your need to discover, to figure out, to understand, to know.
  And thus you can start increasing your vocabulary at the same rate as when you were a child.
  I am not spouting airy theory. For over thirty-five years I have worked with thousands of adults in my college courses in vocabulary improvement, and l can state as a fact, and without qualification, that:
  *If you can recapture the "powerful urge to learn" with which you were born, you can go on increasing your vocabulary at a prodigious rate—* 
  *No matter what your present age.*



**WHY AGE MAKES LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN VOCABULARY BUILDING**

  I repeat, *no matter what your present age.*
  You may be laboring under a delusion common to many older people.
  You may think that after you pass your twenties you rapidly and inevitably lose your ability to learn.
  That is simply not true.
  There is no doubt that the years up to eighteen or twenty are the best period for learning. Your own experience no doubt bears that out. And of course *for most people* more learning goes on faster up to the age of eighteen or twenty than ever after, even if they live to be older than Methuselah. (That is why vocabulary increases so rapidly for the first twenty years of life and comparatively at a snail's pace thereafter.)
  But (and follow me closely)— 
  The fact that most learning is accomplished before the age of twenty does not mean that very little learning can be achieved beyond that age.
  What *is* done by most people and what *can* be done under proper guidance and motivation are two very, very different things—as scientific experiments have conclusively shown.

## HOW TO TALK ABOUT PERSONALITY TYPES
**TEASER PREVIEW**
What word best describes your personality if you:
- are interested solely in your own welfare?
- constantly talk about yourself?
- dedicate your life to helping others?
- turn your mind inward?
- turn your mind outward?
- hate humanity?
- hate women?
- hate marriage?
- lead a lonely, austere existence?

[//]: # "p 27"

**SESSION 1**

Every human being is, in one way or another, unique.
  Everyone's personality is determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
  Let us examine ten personality types (one of which might by chance be your very own) that result from the way culture, growth, family background, and environment interact with heredity. 
  And, of course, we begin not with the words, but with the ideas.

**IDEAS**

1. me first 
  Your attitude to life is simple, direct, and aboveboard—every decision you make is based on the answer to one question: "What's in it for me?" If your selfishness, greed, and ruthless desire for self-advancement hurt other people, that's too bad. "This is a tough world, pal, dog eat dog and all that, and I, for one, am not going to be left behind!"

    An egoist

2. the height of conceit 
  "Now, let's see. Have you heard about all the money I'm making? Did I tell you about my latest amorous conquest? Let me give you my opinion—I know, because I'm an expert at practically everything!" You are boastful to the point of being obnoxious—you have only one string to your conversational violin, namely, *yourself*; and on it you play a number of monotonous variations: what *you* think, what *you* have done, how good *you* are, how *you* would solve the problems of the world, etc. ad nauseam.

    An egotist

[//]: # "p 28"

3. let me help you
  You have discovered the secret of true happiness—concerning yourself with the welfare of others. Never mind your own interests, how's the next fellow getting along?

    An altruist

4. leave me alone 
  Like a biochemist studying a colony of bacteria under the microscope, you minutely examine your every thought, feeling, and action. Probing, futile questions like "What do other people think of me?", "How do I look?" and "Maybe I shouldn't have said that?" are your constant nagging companions, for you are unable to realize that other people do not spend as much time and energy analyzing you as you think.
  You may seem unsocial, yet your greatest desire is to be liked and accepted. You may be shy and quiet, you are often moody and unhappy, and you prefer solitude or at most the company of one person to a crowd. You have an aptitude for creative work and are uncomfortable engaging in activities that require co- 
operation with other people. You may even be a genius, or eventually turn into one.

    An introvert

5. let's do it together
  You would be great as a teacher, counselor, administrator, insurance agent. You can always become interested—sincerely, vitally interested—in other people's problems. You're the life of the party, because you never worry about the effect of your actions, never inhibit yourself with doubt about dignity or propriety. You are usually happy, generally full of high spirits; you love to be with people—lots of people. Your thoughts, your interests, your whole personality are turned outward.

    An extrovert

[//]: # "p 29"

6. neither extreme
  You have both introverted and extroverted tendencies—at different times and on different occasions. Your interests are turned, in about equal proportions, both inward and outward. Indeed, you're quite normal—in the sense that your personality is like that of most people.

    An ambivert

7. people are no damn good
  Cynical, embittered, suspicious, you hate everyone. (Especially, but never to be admitted, *yourself*?) The perfectibility of the human race? "Nonsense! No way!" The stupidity, the meanness, 
and the crookedness of most mortals ("Most? Probably all!")—that is your favorite theme.

    A misanthrope

8. women are no damn good
  Sometime in your dim past, you were crossed, scorned, or deeply wounded by a woman (a mother, or mother figure, perhaps?). So now you have a carefully constructed defense against further hurt—you hate *all* women.

    A misogynist

9. "marriage is an institution—and who wants to live in an institution?"
  You will not make the ultimate *legal* commitment. Members of the opposite sex are great as lovers, roommates, apartment- or house-sharers, but *not* as lawfully wedded spouses. The ties that bind are too binding for you. You may possibly believe, and possibly, for yourself, be right, that a commitment is deeper and more meaningful if freedom is available without judicial proceedings.

    A misogamist

[//]: # "p 30"

10. ". . . that the flesh is heir to . . ."
Self-denial, austerity, lonely contemplation—these are the characteristics of the good life, so you claim. The simplest food and the least amount of it that will keep body and soul together, combined with abstinence from fleshly, earthly pleasures, will eventually lead to spiritual perfection—that is your philosophy. 

    An ascetic

**USING THE WORDS**

You have been introduced to ten valuable words—but in each case, as you have noticed, you have first considered the ideas that these words represent. Now say the words—each one is respelled phonetically so that you will be sure to pronounce it correctly.* 
  *Say each word aloud*. This is the first important step to complete mastery. As you hear a word in your own voice, think of its meaning. Are you quite clear about it? If not, reinforce your learning by rereading the explanatory paragraph or paragraphs.

Can you pronounce the words?
1. egoist    EE'-gō-ist
2. egotist    EE'-gō-tist
3. altruist    AL'-tr$\bar {oo}$-ist
4. introvert    IN'-trə-vurt'
5. extrovert    EKS'-trə-vurt'
6. ambivert    AM'-bə-vurt'

*See Introduction, Section 2, Master the pronunciation system.

7. misanthrope    MIS'-ən-thrōp'
8. misogynist    mə-SOJ'-ə-nist
9. misogamist    mə-SOG'-ə-mist
10. ascetic    ə-SET'-ik

Can you work with the words?
  You have taken two long steps toward mastery of the expressive words in this chapter—you have thought about the ideas behind them, and you have said them aloud.
  For your third step, match each personality with the appropriate characteristic, action, or attitude.

2. egotist
3. altruist
4. introvert
5. extrovert
6. ambivert
7. misanthrope
8. misogynist
9. misogamist
10. ascetic
 
a. turns thoughts inward
b. hates marriage
c. talks about accomplishments
d. hates people
e. does not pursue pleasures of the flesh
f. is interested in the welfare of others 
g. believes in self-advancement

I. hates women
j. turns thoughts outward

```
KEY: 1-g, 2-c, 3-f, 4-a, 5-j, 6-h, 7—d, 8-i, 9—b, 10—e
```

Do you understand the words? 
  Now that you are becoming more and more involved in these ten words, find out if they can make an immediate, appeal to your understanding. Here are ten questions—can you indicate, quickly, and without reference to any previous definitions, whether the correct answer to each of these questions is *yes* or *no?*

[//]: # "p 32"

1. Is an egoist selfish? 
2. Is modesty one of the characteristics of the egotist?
3. Is an altruist selfish?
4. Does an introvert pay much attention to himself?
5. Does an extrovert prefer solitude to companionship?
6. Are most normal people ambiverts?
7. Does a misanthrope like people?
8. Does a misogynist enjoy the company of women?
9. Does an ascetic lead a life of luxury?
10. Does a misogamist try to avoid marriage?

```
KEY: 1—yes, 2—no, 3—no, 4—yes, 5—no, 6—yes, 7—no, 8—no, 9—no, 10—yes
```

Can you recall the words? 
  You have thus far reinforced your learning by saying the words aloud, by matching them to their definitions, and by responding to meaning when they were used in context. 
  Can you recall each word, now, without further reference to previous material? And can you spell it correctly?
 
1. Who lives a lonely, austere life?
2. Whose interests are turned outward?
3. Who is supremely selfish?
4. Who hates people?
5. Whose interests are turned both inward and outward?
6. Who is incredibly conceited?
7. Who is more interested in the welfare of others than in his own?

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

  Every word in the English language has a history—and these ten are no exception. In this section you will learn a good deal more about the .words you have been working with; in addition, you will make excursions into many other words allied either in meaning, form, or history to our basic ten.
 
1. the ego

  *Egoist* and *egotist* are built on the same Latin root—the pronoun *ego*, meaning *I*. *I* is the greatest concern in the *egoist's* mind, the most overused word in the *egotist's* vocabulary. (Keep the words differentiated in your own mind by thinking of the *t* in *talk*, and the additional *t* in *egotist*.) *Ego* itself has been taken over from Latin as an important English word and is commonly used to denote one's concept of oneself, as in, "What do you think your constant criticisms do to my *ego?" Ego* has also a special meaning in psychology—but for the moment you have enough problems without going into *that*.

[//]: # "p 34"

  If you are an egocentric (ee'-gō-SEN'-trik), you consider yourself the *center* of the universe—you are an extreme form of the *egoist*. And if you are an *egomaniac* (ee-gō-MAY'-nee-ak), you carry *egoism* to such an extreme that your needs, desires, and interests have become a morbid obsession, a *mania*. The *egoist* or *egotist* is obnoxious, the egocentric is intolerable, and the egomaniac is dangerous and slightly mad.
  *Egocentric* is both a noun ("What an egocentric her new roommate is!") and an adjective ("He is the most egocentric person I have ever met!")
  To derive the adjective form of *egomaniac*, add *-al*, a common adjective suffix. Say the adjective aloud: 
    *egomaniacal*    ee'-gō-mə-NI'-ə-kəl
    
2. others

  In Latin, the word for *other* is *alter*, and a number of valuable English words are built on this root.
  *Altruism* (AL'-tr$\bar {oo}$-iz-əm), the philosophy practiced by *altruists*, comes from one of the variant spellings of Latin alter, *other*. *Altruistic* (al-tr$\bar {oo}$-lS'-tik) actions look toward the benefit of *others*. If you *alternate* (AWL'-tər-nayt'), you skip one and take the *other*, so to speak, as when you play golf on *alternate* (AWL'-tər-nət) Saturdays.
  An *alternate* (AWL'-tər-nət) in a debate, contest, or convention is the *other* person who will take over if the original choice is unable to attend. And if you have no *alternative* (awl-TUR'-nə-tiv), you have no *other* choice.
  You see how easy it is to understand the meanings of these words once you realize that they all come from the same source.

[//]: # "p 35"

And keeping in mind that *alter* means *other*, you can quickly understand words like *alter* *ego*, *altercation*, and *alteration*.
  An *alteration* (awl'-tə-RAY'-shən) is of course a change—a making into something *other*. When you *alter* (AWL'-tər) your plans, you make *other* plans.
  An *altercation* (awl'-tər-KAY'-shən) is a verbal dispute. When you have an *altercation* with someone, you have a violent disagreement, a "fight" with words. And why? Because you have *other* ideas, plans, or opinions than those of the person on the *other* side of the argument. *Altercation*, by the way, is stronger than *quarrel* or *dispute*—the sentiment is more heated, the disagreement is likely to be angry or even hot-tempered, there may be recourse, if the disputants are human, to profanity or obscenity. You have *altercations*, in short, over pretty important issues, and the word implies that you get quite excited.
  Alter ego (AWL'-tər EE'-gō), which combines *alter*, *other*, with *ego*, I, self, generally refers to someone with whom you are so close that you both do the same things, think alike, react similarly, and are, in temperament, almost mirror images of each other. Any such friend is your *other I,* your *other self,* your *alter ego.*

**USING THE WORDS**

Can you pronounce the words? 
Digging a little into the derivation of three of our basic words, *egoist*, *egotist*, and *altruist*, has put us in touch with two important Latin roots, *ego*, I, *self*, and *alter*, *other*, and has made it possible for us to explore, with little difficulty, many other words derived from these roots. Pause now, for a moment, to digest these new acquisitions, and to say them *aloud*.

**SESSION 3**

ORIGINS AND RELATED WORDS

1. depends how you turn

  *Introvert, extrovert,* and *ambivert* are built on the Latin verb *verto,* to turn. If your thoughts are constantly turned inward (*intro-*), you are an *introvert*; outward (*extro-*), an *extrovert*; and in both directions (*ambi-*), an *ambivert*. The prefix *ambi-*, both, is also found in *ambidextrous* (am'-bə-DEKS'-trəs), *able to use both hands with equal skill*. The noun is *ambidexterity* (am'-bə-deks-TAIR'-ə-tee).
  *Dexterous* (DEKS'-tə-rəs) means *skillful*, the noun *dexterity* (deks-TAIR'-ə-tee) is *skill*. The ending *-ous* is a common adjective suffix (*famous*, *dangerous*, *perilous*, etc.); *-ity* is a common noun suffix (*vanity*, *quality*, *simplicity*, etc.).
  (Spelling caution: Note that the letter following the *t-* in *ambidextrous* is *-r*, but that in dexterous the next letter is *-e*.)
  *Dexter* is actually the Latin word for *right hand*—in the *ambidextrous* person, both hands are *right hands*, so to speak.
  The right hand is traditionally the more skillful one; it is only within recent decades that we have come to accept that "lefties" or "southpaws" are just as normal as anyone else—and the term *left-handed* is still used as a synonym of *awkward*.
  The Latin word for the *left hand* is *sinister*. This same word, in English, means *threatening, evil,* or *dangerous*, a further commentary on our early suspiciousness of left-handed persons. There may still be some parents who insist on forcing left-handed children to change (though left-handedness is inherited, and as much an integral part of its possessor as eye color or nose shape), with various unfortunate results to the child—sometimes stuttering or 
an inability to read with normal skill.

[//]: # "p 40"

  The French word for the *left hand* is *gauche*, and, as you would suspect, when we took this word over into English we invested it with an uncomplimentary meaning. Call someone *gauche* (GŌSH) and you imply clumsiness, generally social rather than physical. (We're right back to our age-old misconception that left-handed people are less skillful than right-handed ones.) A *gauche* remark 
is tactless; a *gauche* offer of sympathy is so bumbling as to be embarrassing; *gaucherie* (GŌ'-shə-ree) is an awkward, clumsy, tactless, embarrassing way of saying things or of handling situations. The *gauche* person is totally without finesse.
  And the French word for the *right hand* is *droit*, which we have used in building our English word adroit (ə-DROYT'). Needless to say, *adroit*, like *dexterous*, means *skillful*, but especially in the exercise of the mental facilities. Like *gauche*, *adroit*, or its noun *adroitness*, usually is used figuratively. The adroit person is quick-witted, can get out of difficult spots cleverly, can handle situations ingeniously. *Adroitness* is, then, quite the opposite of *gaucherie*.

2. love, hate, and marriage 

*Misanthrope*, *misogynist*, and *misogamist* are built on the Greek root *misein*, to hate. The misanthrope hates mankind (Greek an. 
thropos, mankind); the misogynist hates women (Greek gyne, 
woman); the misogamist hates marriage (Greek gamos, mar- 
riage). 
Anthropos, mankind, is also found in anthropology (an-thra- 
POL'-a-jee), the study of the development of the human race; 
and in philanthropist (fa-LAN'-thra-pist), one who loves man- 
kind and shows such love by making substantial financial contri- 
butions to charitable organizations or by donating time and energy 
to helping those in need. 
The root gyne, v man, is also found in gynecologist t ,'iF o- 
KOV-a-3ist or jin-KOV-a-jist), the medical specialis 
ho 
treats female disorders. And the root gamos, marriage, occurs also 
in monogamy (ma-NOG'-a-mee), bigamy (BIG'-a-mee), and 
polygamy (pa-Llff-o-mee). 
(As we will discover later, monos means one, bi- means two, 
polys means many.)
