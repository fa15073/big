## HOW TO TEST YOUR PRESENT VOCABULARY
Once - as a child - you were an expert, an accomplished  virtuoso, at learning new words.
    Today, by comparison, you are a rank and bumbling amateur.
    Dose this statement sound insulting?
    It may be - but if you are the average adult, it is a statement that is, unfortunately, only too true.
    Educational testing indicates that children of ten who have grown up in families in which English is the native language have recognition vocabularies of over twenty thousand words -
    And that these same ten-year-olds have been learning new words at a rate of many hundreds a year since the age of four.
    In astonishing contrast, studies show that adults who are no longer attending school increase their vocabularies at a pace slower than twenty-five to fifty words annually.
    How do you assess your own vocabulary?
    Is it quantitatively healthy?
    Rich in overall range?
    Responsive to any situation in which you may find yourself?
    Truly indicative of your intellectual potential?
    More important, is it still growing at the same rapid rate as when you were a child?
    Or, as with most adults, has your rate of increase dropped drastically since you left school? And if so, do you now feel that your vocabulary is somewhat limited, your verbal skills not as sharp as you would like them to be?
    Let us find out.
    I challenge you to a series of tests that will measure your vocabulary range, as well as your verbal speed and responsiveness.
